# Android Project Work API Contract

Android uses the Vibe Sync Project / Beads Work API as the canonical project-work source for native project workspace screens.

## Canonical endpoints

- `GET /api/projects` — mobile project catalog with repo metadata, tracker capabilities, tracker summary, freshness, version, and ETag.
- `GET /api/projects/{projectId}` — compact project detail.
- `GET /api/projects/{projectId}/ready-work` — Android equivalent of `bd ready`; use this for "what should I work on?".
- `GET /api/projects/{projectId}/issues` — compact issue summaries with status/filter/search/pagination query parameters.
- `GET /api/issues/{issueId}` — full issue detail by stable Beads issue ID.
- `POST /api/issues/{issueId}/claim`
- `POST /api/issues/{issueId}/unclaim`
- `PATCH /api/issues/{issueId}/status`
- `POST /api/issues/{issueId}/notes`
- `POST /api/issues/{issueId}/close`
- `POST /api/issues/{issueId}/reopen`

`/api/registry/projects` remains a legacy/admin registration surface. Android workspace listing should use `/api/projects`.

## Identity and schema rules

- Issue IDs are opaque stable Beads IDs such as `letta-mobile-qmbg`; Android must not parse semantic meaning from them.
- Work payloads are deterministic JSON with `schema_version = 1`.
- Android logic should use normalized `status`; `statusLabel` is display/debug information from the backing tracker.
- Project freshness is represented by `tracker.data_freshness`; issue list freshness is represented by response-level `data_freshness`.

## Mutation rules

All issue mutations must send:

- `If-Match: {issue.etag}`
- `Idempotency-Key: {stable client-generated key}`

Idempotency keys are durable and scoped by `(issue id, action, idempotency key)`. Replaying the same queued mutation with the same key returns the cached mutation result and does not invoke `bd` again. Replayed responses use `applied: false` and `idempotent_replay: true`.

On stale ETags, the API returns `409` with a structured conflict payload. Android should refetch `GET /api/issues/{issueId}`, rebase or discard the queued mutation, then retry only if the user action is still valid.

## Delete/tombstone behavior

Explicit tombstone records are not part of v1 incremental sync. Android must not rely on `updatedSince` to discover deleted issues yet. Treat missing or closed issues conservatively and use a full refresh when reconciling deletes.

## Android implementation files

The current Android data contract lives in:

- `android-compose/core/src/main/java/com/letta/mobile/data/model/Project.kt`
- `android-compose/core/src/main/java/com/letta/mobile/data/model/ProjectWork.kt`
- `android-compose/core/src/main/java/com/letta/mobile/data/api/ProjectApi.kt`
- `android-compose/core/src/main/java/com/letta/mobile/data/api/ProjectWorkApi.kt`
- `android-compose/core/src/main/java/com/letta/mobile/data/repository/ProjectWorkRepository.kt`

Focused coverage lives in:

- `ProjectApiTest`
- `ProjectWorkApiTest`
- `ProjectRepositoryTest`
- `ProjectWorkRepositoryTest`
